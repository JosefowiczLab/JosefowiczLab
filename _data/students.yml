  education1: Andrew got his bachelors in Chemistry and Biochemistry from Seattle Pacific University. He got a job working in an cancer immunology lab, where he stayed for three years before deciding to pursue a PhD at Weill Cornell. Andrew joined the Josefowicz lab in 2018 to work on understanding the role of histone modifications in hematopoietic development.

  education1: Dughan grew up in the beautiful state of New Jersey and went on to receive a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Yale University. He then spent two years working in biotech before deciding to attend Weill Cornell’s IMP Program for graduate school. Dughan joined the Josefowicz Lab in June 2019 to study the function of histone modifications in rapid stimulation-induced gene expression and other epigenetically regulated processes in mammalian immunity.

  education1: Chenyang received her B.S. in biological sciences from Sichuan University and M.S. in pathobiology from University of Connecticut. After graduation, she worked as a research assistant for three years at Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital to study HIV/AIDS by developing and applying novel genetic and epigenetic tools to characterize viral reservoirs in HIV-1 elite controllers. Chenyang joined the Josefowicz Lab in July 2021 to investigate epigenetic regulation of transcription in rapid stimulation-induced immune cell responses.

  education1: Mythili received her B.S. in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2023. While completing her bachelor's degree, she worked as a researcher in the Ramani Lab at UC San Francisco for three years using computational methods to study chromatin remodeling and histone modifications regulating mammalian gene expression. She then began her PhD in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine program as an NSF graduate fellow. Mythili joined the Josefowicz Lab in May 2024 to apply and expand upon computational approaches to study epigenetics (co-advised by Dr. Christina Leslie), with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying development and activation of immune populations.

  education1: Michael received his B.A.s in Chemistry and Physics from the University of Kentucky in 2016 and a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University in 2020. During his masters, Michael was a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland in the Translational Research Unit of the HIV Dynamics and Replication program where he worked on profiling integration site distributions in children living with HIV as well as intra-participant HIV-1 genetics. Michael joined the Josefowicz lab in July of 2021 to investigate the role of epigenetic regulation in the activation and memory differentiation of T cells.

  education1: Muxue “Snow” received her B.S. in Biochemistry and Music from Muhlenberg College in 2021. Upon graduation, she worked as a technician in the Michael Glickman Lab at MSKCC for two years, where she studied the effect of treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis on the gastrointestinal microbiota. She joined IMP in 2023 and joined the Josefowicz/Niec Lab in June 2024.
