  education1: Dughan grew up in the beautiful state of New Jersey and went on to receive a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Yale University. He then spent two years working in biotech before deciding to attend Weill Cornell’s IMP Program for graduate school. Dughan joined the Josefowicz Lab in June 2019 to study the function of histone modifications in rapid stimulation-induced gene expression and other epigenetically regulated processes in mammalian immunity.

  education1: Chenyang received her B.S. in biological sciences from Sichuan University and M.S. in pathobiology from University of Connecticut. After graduation, she worked as a research assistant for three years at Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital to study HIV/AIDS by developing and applying novel genetic and epigenetic tools to characterize viral reservoirs in HIV-1 elite controllers. Chenyang joined the Josefowicz Lab in July 2021 to investigate epigenetic regulation of transcription in rapid stimulation-induced immune cell responses.

  education1: Mythili received her B.S. in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2023. While completing her bachelor's degree, she worked as a researcher in the Ramani Lab at UC San Francisco for three years using computational methods to study chromatin remodeling and histone modifications regulating mammalian gene expression. She then began her PhD in the Tri-Institutional Computational Biology and Medicine program as an NSF graduate fellow. Mythili joined the Josefowicz Lab in May 2024 to apply and expand upon computational approaches to study epigenetics (co-advised by Dr. Christina Leslie), with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying development and activation of immune populations.

  education1: Michael received his B.A.s in Chemistry and Physics from the University of Kentucky in 2016 and a M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University in 2020. During his masters, Michael was a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Maryland in the Translational Research Unit of the HIV Dynamics and Replication program where he worked on profiling integration site distributions in children living with HIV as well as intra-participant HIV-1 genetics. Michael joined the Josefowicz lab in July of 2021 to investigate the role of epigenetic regulation in the activation and memory differentiation of T cells.

  education1: Viggy is a graduate student in the BCMB program at Weill Cornell. She received her Bachelors of Technology degree in Biotechnology from Anna University, India in 2017 and moved to the Unites States to pursue an MS in Biotechnology from the California State University, Channel Islands. During her masters, she joined Dr. Kit Lam's lab at UC Davis as a CIRM Bridges intern and worked on developing peptides for targeting cancer stem cells. After graduation, she joined the Marson Lab at Gladstone Institutes- UCSF as a Research Associate working on genome wide CRISPR screens for understanding HIV latency. Viggy joined the Josefowicz lab in September 2023 and is working on understanding histone mediated regulation of immune cell transcription. Besides lab research, Viggy enjoys photography, reading and exploring the city.

  education1: Tori is from the sunny and definitely-not-rainy-at-all foothills of Seattle, WA. She received her BA in Biology from The University of Chicago, where her undergraduate research utilized the Drosophila egg chamber as a model to study organ morphogenesis. Deciding she was still too close to home, she then relocated to the UK to complete her MPhil with Dr. Greg Hannon at the University of Cambridge, Cancer Research UK – Cambridge Institute. Her master’s work focused on small-RNA mediated suppression of transposable elements in the Drosophila germline. Through this research, she became interested in histone biology and its outsized role in gene regulation. She joined the Tri-Institutional MD/PhD program in 2021 and the Josefowicz Lab in 2023, where she studies the inflammatory signals and chromatin features that guide durable immune memory in hematopoietic stem cells. Outside of lab, you can find her playing lots of soccer, admiring her cat, Sappho, and hunting down the best gelato in NYC.

  education1: Muxue “Snow” received her B.S. in Biochemistry and Music from Muhlenberg College in 2021. Upon graduation, she worked as a technician in the Michael Glickman Lab at MSKCC for two years, where she studied the effect of treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis on the gastrointestinal microbiota. She joined IMP in 2023 and joined the Josefowicz/Niec Lab in June 2024.
